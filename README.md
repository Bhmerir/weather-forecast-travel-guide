# Weather Forecast Travel Guide

Weather forecast is indispensable to travelling. This application gives the weather forecast including today and the next five days for each city given as input. You have also access to all the cities searched previously, and updated weather as well by clicking their buttons. 


<br>
In order to achieve this goal, I took the following steps:

<br>

1. ask the user to enter their desired city

2. present the current weather condition of the searched city including the name of the city, the date, the icon representing of the weather condition, the current temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed 

3. present the future weather conditions of the searched city including the date, the icon representing of the weather condition, the max temperature of that day, the humidity, and the wind speed 

4. add the searched city to the page as a button to keep the search history

5. present the updated weather condition of each previously searched city by clicking their button
